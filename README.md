Old C++ Backend Docs
---------------
Pythia extends the Rusthon C++11 backend to support C++14, with specialized syntax for using the SeaStar 
high performance asyc IO framework.  The C++14 backend makes static typing optional in many cases, this allows you to write python like scripts that are compiled to fast native code.
