'''
Helloworld Example

If this file is compiled without any extra arguments, it will be transpiled using the C++ backend, 
compiled with GCC, and then binary will be executed.
./rusthon.py ./examples/helloworld.py

To transpile with another backend use one of these command line options:
	--javascript
	--rust
	--go

JavaScript Example:
	This will transpile and test it using NodeJS
	./rusthon.py ./examples/helloworld.py --javascript

	This will transpile and save helloworld.js into mytar.tar file
	./rusthon.py ./examples/helloworld.py --javascript /tmp/mytar.tar


Note that using python files (.py) is not the preferred input method,
and instead you should use markdown files (.md) as the container format.

Why are python files not preferred?
Because in regular python files are modules, and provide a namespace for what
they contain.  This is not the case here, where all files are merged into a
single unit of translation.
